	- added _initialize() method
	- added retry for EIDRM error when allocating additional
          segments
	- added version() method for use with per-process caches
	- moved segment state variable from semaphore to shared
          memory (it's faster)
        - modified documentation

	- removed signal stuff from tests
	- added destroy() accessor method
	- added check for EINVAL when locking semaphore in new_share()
	- replaced lock_ex() and lock_sh() methods with single shlock()
          method that accepts flock() flags.  Renamed unlock() to
          shunlock().
	- LOCK_EX, LOCK_SH, LOCK_UN, and LOCK_NB now available for import.
	- replaced sv_setpvn() call with sv_usepvn() in read_share()
          XS function to remove an unnecessary mem copy.
